# Then To Now

ScriptX.Services evolves ScriptX.Add-on to bring controlled printing to any browser on any device by providing a print server on a Microsoft Windows Server/PC.

This sample shows a simple work-through of taking code from:

## Then

Works with ScriptX.Add-on only: [then.htm](then.htm) / [then-ui.htm](then-ui.htm)

### to

## Now

Works with ScriptX.Add-on and ScriptX.Services: [now.htm](now.htm)

But with making a minimum number of changes.

This work-through is discussed at [ScriptX.Services for Windows PC](https://scriptxservices.meadroid.com/OnWorkstation/HowTo).
