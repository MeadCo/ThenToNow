# Then To Now

ScriptX.Services evolves ScriptX.Add-on to bring controlled printing to any browser on any device by providing a print service on a Microsoft Windows Server/PC.

This sample shows a simple work-through of taking code from:

## Then

Works with ScriptX.Add-on only: [then.htm](then.htm) / [then-ui.htm](then-ui.htm)

### to

## Now

Works with ScriptX.Add-on **and** ScriptX.Services: [now.htm](now.htm) having made a minimum number of changes.

This work-through is discussed at [ScriptX.Services for Windows PC](https://scriptxservices.meadroid.com/OnWorkstation/HowTo) though simply by changing the values of attributes will work with any variation of [ScriptX.Services](https://scriptxservices.meadroid.com).

To test and work with the sample code requires the use of a web server to host and serve the .htm files via *localhost* (using http://127.0.0.1 will not work as it is not included in the evaluation license). Use of a simple node.js based server for delivering the files in a file system folder is discussed at [Developer walkthrough](https://scriptxservices.meadroid.com/OnWorkstation/DeveloperThenToNowSample).

Please note that a ScriptX Publishing License is required to use the sample. The sample source references the evaluation license which works with localhost.
