# Then To Now

ScriptX.Services evolves ScriptX.Add-on to bring controlled printing to any browser on any device by providing a print service on a Microsoft Windows Server/PC.

This sample shows a simple work-through of taking code from:

## Then

Works with ScriptX.Add-on only: [then.html](then.html) / [then-ui.html](then-ui.html)

### to

## Now

Works with ScriptX.Add-on **and** ScriptX.Services: [now.html](now.html) having made a minimum number of changes.

## Using the sample

This work-through is discussed in more detail in the 
[ScriptX.Services Getting Started Guide](https://www.meadroid.com/Developers/KnowledgeBank/HowToGuides/ScriptXServices/ThenToNow/Index).

The sample code illustrates working with ScriptX.Services for Windows PC though simply by changing the values 
of attributes will work with any variation of [ScriptX.Services](https://scriptxservices.meadroid.com).

### Working with a node.js based server

To test and work with the sample code requires the use of a web server to host and serve the .html files 
via *http://localhost* (using http://127.0.0.1 will not work as it is not included in the evaluation license).

This sample code will work with any server, including any node.js based server, 
for example [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

Once the server is set-up with this repo view the sample at [http://localhost:8080/index](http://localhost:8080/index)

## License

This repo: [Unlicense](LICENSE).

Please note that a ScriptX Publishing License is required to use the sample. The sample source references the evaluation license which works with localhost.
